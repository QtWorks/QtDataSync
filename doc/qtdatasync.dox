@namespace QtDataSync

The following classes are "user classes". They are what you need to work with datasync:
- Setup
- SyncController
- AsyncDataStore
- CachingDataStore
- GenericTask (and Task, UpdateTask)
- WsAuthenticator (for the default remote connector)

The other classes are "developer classes". They are interfaces, base classes and utilities you
need if you want to extend datasync:
- LocalStore
- StateHolder
- DataMerger
- Encryptor
- RemoteConnector
- Authenticator
- Defaults
